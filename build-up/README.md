# Build Up! The Guide to Great Software Design

For decases, software engineers have written over billions lines of code in different projects. There are many guidelines that have been exploited when writing these software. Among all advises, we choose to present those the most elegant and the easiest to follow when dealing with real-world challenges.

Most engineers might have already applied principles proposed all the time, but they don't realize that this is what they're doing. By explicitly describing and analyzing principles, you'll be more aware of skills and techniques you already possessed, and elimanate counter-principles that get in the way. Each of the proposed principle serves the purpose of designing and building great software.

This is rather a handbook of advises than a collection of nonsenses. No mather you are a rookie programmer or a vetteran architect, I hope the advices presented could shed a light on the problems you're dealing with. In short, each principle tells you how to program in a way that is easy to follow.

Now, let's give a glance on some of the most useful guidelines.
