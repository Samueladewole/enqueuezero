#Make It Work; Make It Right; Make It Fast

This formulation of statement has existed for a very long time as part of the Unix Philosophy. "Make It Work" teaches us it doesn't mater what the form of the early implementation is, whater it's ugly or neat, as long as it works. "Make It Right" says the second step is to make the code more clear and fix for corner cases. Finally, "Make It Fast" says the performance of the program is of importance; of course, we only speed up where it is needed.
