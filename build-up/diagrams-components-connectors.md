# Diagrams, Components, and Connectors

How do we *describe* the design of the software? We implement the software by writing code; With hindsight, we can, of course, perceive the overall design by reading the code, configuration, document, and inspect the runtime data structures. But that takes a lot of efforts and doesn't help at the early stage.

Drawing a diagram is a solution. A diagram is a symbolic representation of the software using visualization techniques. This technique has been used since ancient time, and it's still the most powerful tool. Human beings are very good at reading information deduce patterns from images.

We tend to use some of the simplest elements to design software â€” for example, blocks and lines. Blocks can be in shape of a square, a circle or a eclipse, color-filled, etc. Lines can be dashed, dotted, weighted, arrowed, curved, etc.

In the software design diagram, a block represents to a component, a building block of the software. A line represents a connector, the conceptual connection between multiple components. Some text are around the blocks and the lines for giving a supplement description.

A component encapsulates a piece of the system that serves as a building block when building the system. From a developer's perspective, components are programming language elements, such as classes, objects, modules, or a set of related functions. From an operator's perspective, components are nodes, processes, containers, services, etc.

When we speak of component, we often mix using component types and component instances. The component types are defined in the code, while the component instances runs in the runtime.

A connector encapsulates the interactions and data exchange between components. From a developer's perspective, connectors can be declared as import statements or sockets. From an operator's perspective, connectors are wires, gateways, proxies, etc.

Connectors, like components, are first citizens in the software design. It simplies the design of the system. Without connectors, there will be too much components in one diagram. For example, we can, of course, describe a message queue instance between publisher and consumer; we can also describe a connector linking the publisher and consumer. In the latter example, the connector encapsulates the queue semantic.

**Case Study: Architecture of SQLite.** Let's take SQLite's architecture diagram as an example. The below diagram shows the main components of SQLite and how they interoperate.

![SQLite architecture](https://www.sqlite.org/images/arch2.gif)

SQLite (v3) consists of eleven components grouping in four categories: Core, SQL compiler, Backend, and Accessories. All these components are described as shadowed blocks, and the categories are described as color-filled blocks.

The arrowed connectors marks how data flows from one component to the next. It starts from *Interface* and ends at *OS Interface*. The in and out connectors between *Core* and *SQL Compilers* provides a zoom-in view on *SQL Command Processor*. The missing connectors on *Accessories* and the other components are intentionally removed to reduce distraction from reading the main data flow, which is a very common used trick.

In short, this diagram is a neat modeling of the design of SQLite. We only discussed how to describe the software design by drawing diagram here. If you'd like to know more about the architecture of SQLite, don't miss the document <https://www.sqlite.org/arch.html>. It attaches one to three short paragraphs describing each component.
