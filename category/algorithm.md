## [Count Distinct](/count-distinct.html)

Count-distinct problem is a problem of finding the number of distinct elements in a data set or data stream, within which you might possibly see some repeated elements. For example, `[1, 3, 2, 1, 5, 2, 4]` has 5 distinct elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

## [HyperLogLog](/hyperloglog.html)

HyperLogLog is an algorithm that can solve Count Distinct problem. It can provide estimated count on a very large data stream.
