## The Curious Case of BEAM CPU Usage

[stressgrid.com](https://stressgrid.com/blog/beam_cpu_usage/)

Key takeaway is BEAM’s busy wait settings do have a significant impact on CPU usage. The highest impact was observed on the instance with the most available CPU capacity. When running BEAM on an OS kernel shared with other software, it makes sense to turn off busy waiting, to avoid stealing time from non-BEAM processes. It would also make sense to not use busy waiting when running on burstable performance instances in the cloud.

## Cloud Native Application Architecture

Principles:

* Designed As Loosely Coupled Microservices;
* Developed With Best-of-breed Languages And Frameworks;
* Center Around APIs For Interaction And Collaboration; 
* Stateless And Massively Scalable;
* Resiliency At The Core Of the Architecture;
* Packaged As Lightweight Containers And Orchestrated;
* Agile DevOps & Automation Using CI/CD;
* Elastic — Dynamic scale-up/down.
* Strategies for implementing resiliency:
  * Retry transient failures ; 
  * Load balance across instances ; 
  * Degrade gracefully; 
  * Throttle high-volume tenants/users;
  * Use a circuit breaker;
  * Apply compensating transactions.
