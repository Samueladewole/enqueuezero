## A Kubernetes Developer Workflow for MacOS

[medium.com](https://medium.com/@mo_keefe/a-kubernetes-development-workflow-for-macos-8c41669a4518)

This article introduces a set of kube-extended tools for macOS users: kubectx, kubectl alias, krew, skaffold, dive, stern.

## WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW - GitOps

[weave.works](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/)

GitOps is a way to do Continuous Delivery.  It works by using Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications.

Rules:

* Everything that can be described must be stored in git.
* Kubectl should not be used directly.
* Use a Kubernetes controller that follows an operator pattern.

Below is a typical GitOps flow.

* A pull request for a new feature is pushed to GitHub for review.
* The code is reviewed and approved by a colleague. After the code is revised, and re-approved it is merged to Git.
* The Git merge triggers the CI and build pipeline, runs a series of tests and then eventually builds a new image and deposits to the new image to a registry.
* "Deployment Automator"  watches the image registry, notices the image, pulls the new image from the registry and updates its YAML in the config repo.
* "Deployment Synchronizer" (installed to the cluster), detects that the cluster is out of date. It pulls the changed manifests from the config repo and deploys the new feature to production.

## Introducing AresDB: Uber’s GPU-Powered Open Source, Real-time Analytics Engine

[eng.uber.com](https://eng.uber.com/aresdb/)

AresDB is an open source, real-time analytics engine that leverages an unconventional power source, graphics processing units (GPUs), to enable our analytics to grow at scale. The article describes the design of AresDB.

At a high level, AresDB stores most of its data in host memory (RAM that is connected to CPUs), handling data ingestion using CPUs and data recovery via disks. At query time, AresDB transfers data from host memory to GPU memory for parallel processing on GPU.

AresDB’s architecture supports the following features:
* Column-based storage with compression
* Real-time upsert with primary key deduplication
* GPU powered query processing
