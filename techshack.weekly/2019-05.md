## Our Software Dependency Problem

[swtch.com](https://research.swtch.com/deps)

* A dependency is additional code that you want to call from your program. Adding a dependency avoids repeating work already done: designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining a specific unit of code.
* A dependency manager (sometimes called a package manager) automates the downloading and installation of dependency packages.
* When consuming software dependencies,
  * Recognize the problem.
  * Establish best practices for today.
  * Develop better dependency technology for tomorrow.
