Many people, when confronted writing HTML document, think "Well, HTML is tedious, I'll go with Markdown." Then they'll face two problems. For programming zealots, they certainly will introduce a third problem: why not write a Markdown parser?

In practice, most Markdown parser programs are often regular expression, or regex, based. There are some more options like PEG, BNF, etc. In this post, we'll write a simple but extensive piece of code that performs basic Markdown parsing task. Beyond that, we'll also discuss how to improve the code to support more and more Markdown notations and dialects.

TBD
