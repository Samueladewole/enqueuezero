Dear my funders,

This is the weekly newsletter on Enqueue Zero new posts. I'm trying to break  down topics into small posts. The tiddlywiki has a nice feature that it can include some other notes into one note, for example, this is the raft topic that compiles from below three raft related posts. 

* [Raft - the nature of time](/raft-and-the-nature-of-time.html)
* [Raft - The gears are unreliable](/raft-and-unreliable-network.html)
* [Raft - Exploiting the Stream Paradigm](/raft-and-stream-paradigm.html)

Besides, I have some other posts.

* [The Difference Between SLA SLO and SLI](/the-difference-between-sli-slo-and-sla.html)
* [Periodic Scheduler](/periodic-scheduler.html)
* [Timezone](/timezone.html)

Enjoy reading. :)
