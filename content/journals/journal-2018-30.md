Dear my pledgers, here comes our new issue.

* [FFI](/ffi.html). Foreign Function Interface is a bridging technology between VM languages and shared libraries. I wrote this post after a tough battle in implementing FFI in my previous educable scripting language [ao](https://github.com/soasme/ao). Besides, I introduced Grammarly to help improving grammar and verbals.

* Several old posts are improved as well with the help of Grammarly.

* [Container](/container.html). I wrote this post for the entire week. Although it's not that long, it takes many time to read manual document and run commands to check container behaviors. At last I gain a deeper understanding of container. It's awesome that it could inspire someone [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/92lptc/yet_another_container_101_post/).

* I'm planning to release a set of topics as well, which will explain concepts in several ways, such as interactive demos, asciinema records, animations and so on. I was especially inspired by the keepachangelog. It can be seen as a boon to existing topics. It will based on the handy Lektor engine. 

* Goal $20 of $100 per month reached. Hooray. :)
