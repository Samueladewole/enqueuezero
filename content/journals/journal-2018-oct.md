Dear my readers, this is the update of October of 2018.

I've been unproductive in the new post for a month as I was into a dense development in [nim-markdown]. The progress of this month is the [Markdown Parser]. I was intended to write a blog post, but the output was beyond my expectation. As a side effect, the library [nim-markdown] is work-in-progress. I've received a lot of [feebacks](https://github.com/soasme/nim-markdown/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) from the Nim community, which I felt are very positive. Even better, it seems that the library will have an early consumer - nim forum might use it at some time [1]. I'll keep developing and expect more consumers.

The other post I wrote in this month was [The Architecture of SQLAlchemy](https://enqueuezero.com/the-architecture-of-sqlalchemy.html), though it seems far from complete.

Anyway, I think it's a good time shifting my focus back to the other posts I want to write. See you next time!
