Kia ora, my pledgers. Yet another great weekends. First thing first, let's count what we have this week:

* Post: Back-pressure. Not much to say on this post. It's easy and short one. Very simple but powerful strategy to keep the system away from crashing.

* Post: URL Dispatcher. I compared several web frameworks. Well actually the idea  came from one night when my wife and I read through Django document. URL Dispatcher seems not that big a topic but the design pattern is actually being spread into so many frameworks. 

* Source code: github.com/soasme/linkedlist. To be honest, I haven't had enough time to nail down verbals for this. I just wrote a pure C library that implemented LinkedList data structure and some important interfaces. Even though I gained a huge pleasure when coding. I felt like I was back to Uni and upload my course homework. Coding just refreshed my memory. Next week, I'll write one post on it.

* Source code: github.com/soasme/ao. This week I was traversing somewhere very corner in the Internet and found this: picol - A pure C implementation of TCL script written by @antirez. I'm not strong enough like @antirez just using 3 hours implementing a scripting language in pure C. Actually it took me entire day over the weekend, and some more earlier days to design the minimal language syntax. Eventually in this Sunday night, I could finally place it on the table of this week's update in time. It is still buggy but I'll try to make it implement correctly next. Either way, I think I have so much thing to discuss from practicing: EBNF, Opcode design of different languages, JIT, etc. It's so fun!

Sorry didn't create that much posts like previous week but I think coding is just as much important as writing, and it's worthwhile taking equal time. I will have a PTO last week to Cook Islands for a few days break, so not much update next week. But I promise I'll create more after back!
