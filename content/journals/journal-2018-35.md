Dear my funders, here comes the new issue.

[Two-Phase Locking](/2pl.html). The 2PL is the basic algorithm in relational database.

[Airbnb Architecture](/airbnb-architecture.html). It's quite interesting to outline the architecture of Airbnb without knowing too much details. Fortunately, the Airbnb engineering blog reveals a lot of information so that we can know how they implemented stuffs. We can at least know that it uses AWS heavily, uses chef to manage infrastructure, uses Rails as front-end app framework, and uses customized framework for internal microservices.

Enjoy reading. :)
