Hello everyone, two weeks passed. Now I bring all ya some new posts.

* New 404 Page. I try to glue all potential topics into one posts and has integrated about 100 topics into it. I will grow it and make it as another kind of table of index.

* [Load](/load.html). This post is heavily influenced by Prometheus document but it's absolutely not tied to any specific tool or technology. Load of distributed system is much more complicated than single-box.

* [Coroutine](/coroutine.html). This post explains coroutine and compare different APIs in Lua, Python, and Ruby.

* [Language Grammar](/language-grammar.html). In this post, I introduced BNF, EBNF, ABNF. Maybe I should also put Lex/Yacc as well? Some references like Python / Go official EBNF representation are included. I also embed a tiny tutorial on how to implement a small language.

* [AO](http://github.com/soasme/ao). Reimplemented Language VM interpreter. Support raise / catch error. The weather of Cook Islands was not good and thus I have plenty of time thinking syntax. Finally I presented this solution: `value or error = call()`. It's just like Golang or Haskell but looks like in more plain English.

A little bit unpleased that I didn't create funny animated creation. Maybe next time.

Any mistake or errors, please tweet to @EnqueueZero. See you next week. :)
