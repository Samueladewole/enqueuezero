Dear my readers, this is the update of week 38 of 2018.

First thing first, four posts have been made.

* [Layered Architecture](https://enqueuezero.com/layered-architecture.html)
* [Pseudo-Random Numbers](https://enqueuezero.com/pseudo-random-numbers.html)
* [Apscheduler](https://enqueuezero.com/apscheduler.html)
* [WSGI](https://enqueuezero.com/wsgi.html)

What's more, with the help of Pelican, now subscribing the RSS feed is getting easier: [https://enqueuezero.com/feeds/all.atom.xml](https://enqueuezero.com/feeds/all.atom.xml) . You may subscribe it in any RSS reader you want.

From this week, I started to organize my work on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/soasme/EnqueueZero/issues) & [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/soasme/EnqueueZero/projects/1). The intent was to make my work as transparent as possible. Publishing the progress of writing is also an excellent way to push me to finish a topic rather than overthink without ending writing a post. I'll try to write the articles based on the input queue order, but they might be published at any time based on their completeness.

Last but not least, I want to say great thanks to my funders. It's so amazing that I'm still being motivated after three months. So, as a gift, I want to display the avatar of my funders on the [index page](https://enqueuezero.com/) and [GitHub project index](https://github.com/soasme/EnqueueZero). To clarify, as long as you have funded at least $1, then you have the privilege to be on the list. It doesn't matter if you pull your fund at any moment in the future. You'll be in the Hall Of Fame forever. Of course, if you don't want to be on the list, let me know. :)
