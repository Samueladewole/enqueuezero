# Enqueue Zero

Kia ora! I am the creator of Enqueue Zero (<https://enqueuezero.com>), a site that
explains code principles to Developers/DevOps/Sysadmins. This site is updated under
a single man team since 2018.

I have written dozens of articles and thoughts on different topics. Apart from
posts, I also maintain EnqueueZero-derived OSS projects. EnqueueZero has became a
very important part-time job for me.  Besides, I want to run an ad-free website.
It can't last long without your donation.
