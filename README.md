# Enqueue Zero

Kia ora! I am the creator of **Enqueue Zero** (<https://enqueuezero.com>), a site that
explains code principles to Developers/DevOps/Sysadmins. This site is updated under
a single man team since 2018.

I have written dozens of articles and thoughts on different topics. Apart from
posts, I also maintain EnqueueZero-derived OSS projects. Enqueue Zero has become a
very important part-time job for me.  Besides, I want to run an ad-free website.
It can't last long without your donation.

Appreciate your donation on [Patreon]. It motivates myself to write more.
And thanks for being my AWESOME reader!
