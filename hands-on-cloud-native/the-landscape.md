# The Landscape of Cloud Native Application

Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

## What is Cloud Native Application?

Here is a definition from Wikipedia.

> [Cloud Native Application is] a type of computer software that natively utilizes services and infrastructure provided by cloud computing providers.

The application running in the cloud computing platform is not equal to Cloud Native Application. The Cloud Native approach is about to utilize containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure and declarative APIs, etc. You can find a curated list of open source cloud native applications on GitHub, <https://github.com/helm/charts>. You might see some software come from the old age but embrace the Cloud Native approach, and eventually, find a larger stage in the new ear and gain more popularities.

## Why use Cloud Native Application?

<!-- TODO -->

To summarize, the pros of Cloud Native are:

* Cost less, but gain more. Allocate sufficient cloud resources just as you need.
* In favor of microservices architecture.
* Getting full observability on every components in the system.
* Resilient environments: a Cloud Native application can handle well from failure.
* Automatically scale up and down.

<!-- TODO -->

To summarize, Cloud Native Application is facing below challenges:

* The data persistence is hard.
* Thinking the full landscape from organization perspective is hard.
* Designing a well-decoupled microservices is hard.
* Bring the cloud into local development is hard.
