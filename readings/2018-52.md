# EnqueueZero Updates 2018-52

Kia ora! I am the creator of **Enqueue Zero** (<https://enqueuezero.com>), a site that explains code principles to Developers/DevOps/Sysadmins. This site is updated under a single man team since 2018. The `EnqueueZero Updates ${YEAR}.${WEEK}` series is comprised of a bunch of interesting posts I wrote or found on the Internet. More importantly, I hope these posts would please you.

## DNS Load Balancing in Cloud-era

[enqueuezero.com](https://enqueuezero.com/dns-load-balancing.html)

DNS load balancing distributes requests across multiple IP addresses by configuring various DNS A records. Modern tools enable programmatically updating DNS records. When the incident happens, some of them can even automatically update the DNS records. The downside of DNS load balancing is that it cannot distribute requests evenly to the backend servers.

## Envoy Proxy at Reddit

[redditblog.com](https://redditblog.com/2018/12/18/envoy-proxy-at-reddit/)

This post discusses the usage of Envoy Proxy at Reddit in order to reduce the complexity of services interacting with each other. In particular, Envoy, as a replacement of Airbnb [SmartStack](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/smartstack-service-discovery-in-the-cloud-4b8a080de619) is a Service-to-Service L4/L7 Proxy.

Migrating to the new system is not easy work, and hence it's a step by step improving. Reddit currently mixes using SmartStack(Synapse, HAProxy, Nervel) and Envoy - it still uses Nerve and Synapse to handle service registration and discovery and uses Envoy for basic TCP proxying.

Let's see how the system eventually ends later. :)

## Clojure’s stability: lessons learned

Aka, why is clojure so stable?

[words.steveklabnik.com](https://words.steveklabnik.com/why-is-clojure-so-stable)

Clojure has a well-deserved reputation for stability. 

* Rich, the [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) or Benevolent dictator for life, deserves a lot of credit.
* Clojure as a Lisp dialect is lack of syntax, and thus rarely grows syntactically. New syntaxes are introduced through macros.
* Clojure is dynamically typed - it can be easier to change a dynamic system than a static one.
* Clojure development is slow - It’s much easier to keep things stable when you don’t change as often.
