# EnqueueZero Updates 2018-52

Kia ora! I am the creator of **Enqueue Zero** (<https://enqueuezero.com>), a site that explains code principles to Developers/DevOps/Sysadmins. This site is updated under a single man team since 2018. The `EnqueueZero Updates ${YEAR}.${WEEK}` series is comprised of a bunch of interesting posts I wrote or found on the Internet. More importantly, I hope these posts would please you.
