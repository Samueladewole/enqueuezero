# Concrete Architecture

For decades, software engineers think complexity is the biggest enemy when building concrete architecture. Code principles are discovered, though there is no silver bullet. Nonetheless, we have to get things work even  when it seems impossible. Trade-off are introduced to make something easy and, unavoidably, the others hard. We'll list as much code principles out in this journey for building concrete architecture.
