# Concrete Architecture

For decades, software engineers think complexity is the biggest enemy when building concrete architecture. Principles are discovered to control complexity. Among all principles, we choose those simplest and most elegant when applying to real-world problems. We'll see a number of code principles for building concrete architecture by learning from well designed open source software. We'll also show how to apply different set of principles.

Most engineers already apply principles proposed in the journey all the time, but they don't realize that this is what they're doing. By explicitly describing and analyzing principles, you'll be more aware of skills and techniques you already possessed, and eliminating counter-principles that get in the way. Each of the proposed principle serves the purpose of building concrete architecture.
