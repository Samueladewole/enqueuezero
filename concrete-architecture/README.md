# Concrete Architecture

For decades, software engineers think complexity is the biggest enemy when building concrete architecture. Principles are discovered to control complexity. Among all principles, we choose those simplest and most elegant when applying to real-world problems. We'll see a number of code principles for building concrete architecture by learning from well designed open source software. We'll also show how to apply different set of principles.
