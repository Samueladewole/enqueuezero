Hello everyone, yet another week passed! I'm thrilled that https://enqueuezero.com had 5 new posts this week!  They're listed below:

* New post published: [12 Factor](https://enqueuezero.com/12-factor.html). I tried to add some memo on original 12 factors, which I thought it would be much more practical and easier to understand.
* New post published: [Load Balance](https://enqueuezero.com/load-balance.html). I wrote it on paper at first, LOL.
* New post published: [Async and Sync](https://enqueuezero.com/async-and-sync.html). One night I was reading Chapter 6 of Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment, and all of a sudden I found I made a mistake actually. I mentioned that there was only blocking & non-blocking I/O, which is totally wrong. There are at least five I/O models: blocking, non-blocking, multiplex, sigio, aio. Thanks to W. Richard Stevens' book! TIL!
* New post published: [Lock-free Queues](https://enqueuezero.com/lock-free-queues.html). It's quite happy when reading the paper. The author has made very clear how to write a lock-free queue. Before reading paper, I discussed this question with my wife. Without knowing there's a CAS CPU instruction, we've getting answers quite closer. It turns out the algorithm itself it not very difficult. Meanwhile, the paper will states some problems such as ABA, retry-loop, which makes the paper very convincible. 
* New post published: [Actor Model](https://enqueuezero.com/actor-model.html). I searched a lot of Actor Model. Akka's implementation is quite complicated. There is a C-lib called libactor but not well maintained for years. Besides, it's using pthread under the hood. Finally, I found  the BEAM book, in which it explains how Erlang implement its Process. If I just learn the related API, I would be so confused that how concurrency being achieved without the help of Process and Thread. Although the BEAM book is not yet finish, it has been really something!
I haven't decided which topics will be covered next week but it's so fun for now!
