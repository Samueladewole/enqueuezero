Just released a new post: [SQL Index](https://enqueuezero.com/sql-index.html). Within the post, I introduced the underlying data structures of the SQL index, the advantages, the disadvantages and how to diagnose performance issue. Enjoy reading!

Tomorrow is a public holiday: Queen's Birthday, which means I will have some extra time. I hope I can add one new post tomorrow!
